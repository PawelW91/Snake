# Snake Unity Game

## Description

A Snake game implemented in Unity. The game currently supports a single-player mode, and in the future, I plan to introduce a multiplayer mode for 2 to 4 players on a single map, with various bonuses for food.

The May release marked version 1.0.
It includes a complete game experience: Menu + Options, One fully playable map without bugs for a single player, one type of food increasing the snake's length, Score/High score, Game Over screen with functional buttons, animations + sounds, active buttons during the game - pause, change speed.

Check out the gameplay video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRN-hNcpuhc).

To run the game, you need to prepare a Unity build. Follow the steps below:

## How to Run the Game

1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/PawelW91/Snake
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Set up the necessary configurations and build settings.
4. Build the project using Unity's build tools.
5. Run the built executable to play the game.

## System Requirements

- Unity (version 3.7.0)

## Ideas and Future Plans

1. Local multiplayer for 2-4 players (Online multiplayer - a more challenging goal).
2. Multiple maps to choose from.
3. Different types of food:
   a) Change the snake's movement speed (bonus + and bonus -),
   b) Increase/decrease the length of the snake by a few segments,
   c) After collision, no game over - only a penalty reducing the snake's length by X segments - game over when there are not enough segments / no game over, only a reset to zero,
   d) In multiplayer, no ability to adjust speed,
   e) ...
